# my-first-repo
I am a brand new software engineer at the Marcy Lab School with a passion to learn about the fundamentals of computer programming.
My name is Joseph Giler and I am an ecuadorian from both of parent's side.
I have always have had a passion for tech, and this passion has shifted into delving into programming. 
In the upcoming months I hope to learn everything I need to be a successful software engineer. 
This is a new line to test out branching.
